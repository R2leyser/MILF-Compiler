# MILF

this is a project that I'm doing just for fun

if you use this in production for whatever reason.... what is wrong with you

## About what I'm doing 

- This is going to compile to LLVM intermediate representation
- If I make a good enough language I'm gonna rewrite the compiler in it so that is going to be fun

I'm doing it in C++ because I felt like coding in it, I'm far from good at writing C++ code
